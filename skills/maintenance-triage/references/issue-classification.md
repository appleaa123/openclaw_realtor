## Emergency Decision Tree

```
Is keyword present?
├── "flood" / "burst pipe" / "water everywhere" → YES, water emergency
├── "gas smell" / "gas leak" → YES, call 911 first, then manager
├── "no heat" + month is Oct–Apr → YES, HVAC emergency
├── "sparks" / "electrical burning" → YES, electrical emergency
└── else → Standard triage workflow
```

## Visual Analysis Cues (Photo/Video)

When analyzing attachment images:
- Visible water on floor/ceiling → water damage
- Blackened outlets or burn marks → electrical damage
- Appliance with visible damage, no power → appliance
- Missing/damaged shingles, wet insulation → roof
- Pooled water near foundation → Improper Surface Grading
- General wear, broken fixtures → maintenance

## Classification Priority

When multiple issues are present, classify by highest severity:
1. Emergency (any) — override all else
2. water damage
3. electrical damage
4. HVAC
5. appliance / roof
6. maintenance / Improper Surface Grading
